#### AI Generated Summary

The posts are discussing the upcoming Singapore presidential election. The main
candidates being discussed are Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Ng Kok Song, George
Goh, and Tan Kin Lian.
- There is debate around whether George Goh and Tan Kin Lian will qualify to run, or if
they will be disqualified by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). Some expect the
PEC will allow all 4 to run to dilute the votes and help Tharman win.
- Many are skeptical of Tharman's independence from the PAP despite his resignation.
There is suspicion he is the PAP's preferred candidate along with Ng Kok Song. Some
plan to vote for other candidates to avoid having a PAP-linked president.
- If George Goh is disqualified, some will vote for Tan Kin Lian instead as the
non-establishment choice. Others may vote for Ng Kok Song to send a protest vote
against Tharman.
- There is criticism that the eligibility criteria unfairly favor PAP-linked candidates over
non-establishment ones.
- Some feel Tharman is overqualified for a ceremonial presidency role and plan to vote
against him so he can return to Parliament. Others feel he is the best candidate on
merits.
- There are jokes/discussions about Ng Kok Song's relationship with his much younger
fianc√©e.
- Some are advocating strategic voting to maximize chances of a non-PAP president.
There is also discussion on how to minimize Tharman's margin of victory.
- If only Tharman and Ng Kok Song qualify, some may not vote at all in protest or spoil
votes.

In summary, the main issue is whether voters view Tharman as independent enough given his
PAP history, and how to prevent having a PAP-linked president.

#### AI Generated Insights

- There is a strong anti-establishment sentiment among many forum participants who want
a non-PAP president. They view the presidency as needing to serve as a check against
the ruling party's power.
- However, voters are split between picking candidates based on merit (with many viewing
Tharman as the most qualified) versus picking non-establishment candidates to send a
protest signal. There doesn't seem to be consensus.
- The eligibility criteria for private sector candidates are seen as overly restrictive and
biased in favor of the establishment. - - There is skepticism that the process is truly open
and transparent.
- Strategic voting considerations seem to dominate over simply picking the individual
candidate they prefer. There is a game theory aspect at play in trying to coordinate a
non-establishment win.
- The lack of independent oversight and transparency in processes like candidate
qualification adds to suspicions of manipulation to pre-determine outcomes.
- Lighthearted discussions around some candidates reveal public views. For example,
jokes about Ng Kok Song's wife suggest skepticism towards the relationship.
- Crowdsourcing decisions and strategies demonstrates how engaged citizens feel
empowered to influence outcomes when united on social media.

In summary, the forum discussions reveal skepticism of government motives, desire for more
independent oversight, and an engaged citizenry willing to coordinate against establishment
candidates. However, voters remain split on how to balance merit versus anti-establishment
protest.
